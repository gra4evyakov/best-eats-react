# Best Eats
## The first project in which I used React. The site provides standard functionality (sorting, shopping cart). The site is written using React JavaScript library, Tailwinds CSS.
### There was no shopping cart on the layout based on which I created the site. It follows from this that everything except the basket should work well. When creating a bucket, I had difficulties with passing parameters to components and inheriting states. Later the problem was closed, but I did not edit the project to see the progress in the following works. 

### You can take a look at the website and lick your lips by clicking on the link below.
